This project's purpose was to build a data structure that supports the following operations:

INITIALIZE(k):  the constructor sets the integer parameter k > 0, 
                which will never be modified afterwards.
                
OFFER(x): Add x to the data structure.

MAX: Return the maximum of the last k offered elements. 
     If the data structure contains less than k elements, 
     it returns the maximum element offered so far.
